# SEIR_MODEL
In here is a collection of Jupyter notebooks from my UCC Physics Final Year Project on modelling Covid-19 in Ireland.

Special thanks to Dr. Bryan Kelleher in the UCC Physics department for supervising this project.

Apologies in advance to anyone reading through this code, it is very messy and not well commented!
